}

const came1 : denim = {
    name : "shivam",

    logo :"bamboo" // we cannot any things in this as you can see idk why we need to know
}

let demi: demin={
    name: "shastry",
    age: 14,
    wow: "why you doing this"
}

const p3: denim = came 
const p2: demin = came // this can't be done with type


//find why the above one work and why not the third one 




Recently, during a React interview, I asked a candidate:
“Can you explain the Virtual DOM in React?”
candidate quickly replied:
"It's a lightweight copy of the real DOM. Doing operations on the real DOM is expensive, but on the virtual DOM it's not."
I nodded and followed up:
“What does ‘lightweight copy’ mean, exactly—and why is it not expensive on the virtual DOM?”
At that moment, the candidate paused. The conversation stalled. This is a common pattern I’ve seen—most developers know the phrase, but few can dig deeper into its meaning.
Let’s break it down and clarify what this really means!
🔸 The Real DOM:
The DOM (Document Object Model) is the browser’s live representation of a web page.
It’s a complex, tree-like structure with tons of properties, methods, and references.
Updating the real DOM is resource-heavy—every change can trigger layout recalculations and repaints, which slows down performance.
🔸 The Virtual DOM:
React’s Virtual DOM isn’t a full clone of the real DOM.
Instead, it’s a streamlined JavaScript object tree that contains just the essential information about your UI: element types, attributes, and children.
It doesn’t include browser-specific details, event listeners, or rendering logic—just enough to describe what the UI should be.
So, what does “lightweight copy” actually mean?
➡️ Minimalist Structure:
The Virtual DOM strips away the complexity. It holds only the data React needs to compare changes and decide what updates to make.
➡️ Pure JavaScript Objects:
No heavy browser APIs, just simple objects. This makes it extremely fast to create and modify.
➡️ No Immediate Rendering:
Changes to the Virtual DOM don’t instantly affect what users see. React first calculates what’s changed, then efficiently updates only the affected parts of the real DOM.
➡️ Performance-Oriented:
Because it’s so lightweight, React can quickly “diff” the old and new Virtual DOM trees and batch updates—making the UI feel snappy even in complex apps.

Have you faced this question in interviews, or do you have your own way of explaining the Virtual DOM?
